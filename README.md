## The Challenge

![preview](./preview.jpg)

Your challenge is to build out this mortgage repayment calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible. This project has already been configured with Bootstrap (with custom SCSS variables), and we've started the first client component to demonstrate how we expect components and CSS to be structured.

The design files are in the `/design` folder. You will find `.jpg` image files for desktop and mobiles designs, as well as a Figma file. Image/font assets are already optimized and included in the `/public` folder.

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

Development requirements:

- Utilize Bootstrap classes and variables for styling. Custom CSS is acceptable, but should be minimal and use Bootstrap CSS variables where possible.
- No additional CSS frameworks (e.g. Tailwind CSS, etc.)
- No UI Component libraries (e.g. Material UI, Chakra UI, Bootstrap React, etc.)
- No additional state management libraries (e.g. Redux, Recoil, etc.)
  
<!-- NOTE ALERT  -->
> [!WARNING]
> _We understand there are many wonderful component libraries and state management tools available, but we're looking to evaluate your understanding of CSS, state, and memoization._
